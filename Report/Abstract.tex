This Project is about the development, setup, testing and qualification of an Electronic Lead screw (ELS). This project was proposed to the university by myself because of the limited possibilities of practical projects due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
Its aim is to develop a system to replace the gearbox inside a conventional lathe, which will synchronize the rotation of the Lead screw to the rotation of the main spindle.
The ELS need to be able to keep up with the spindle rotation during conventional turning with different feeds and speeds. In addition to this, it should be possible to cut
precise metric and imperial threads.\\
 
The electromechanical system of the ELS is build around an encoder to read the rotational position of the main spindle and a servo motor to control the position of the Lead screw.
A microcontroller computes the information gathered by the encoder and commands the servo-motor to the correct positions.\\
 
To be able to easily change and add features as well as to predict the behavior of the system, the development of the ELS needs to be model based. This model needs to incorporate all aspects of the system including the spindle, the encoder, the microcontroller and the servo motor. As comparison, the conventional gearbox should also be modeled.\\
