The Electronic Lead screw system offers due to the modularity of the control software and the interface the opportunity to add further functions to the system. In the future, modes for circular grinding as well as partially automated threading are planned. However, more important additions to the Electronic Lead screw system will be a cabinet for the electronics. This cabinet and its components were already planned and ordered during the project, but did not arrive in time due to a global electronics shortage.\\
Further, a Variable Speed Drive (VSD) will be added to the main spindle in the future. A VSD enables the operator to control the speed of the main spindle step-less. In addition to that, the VSD could be controlled connected to the ELS. This would enable features such as automatic threading or turning.
