At this point I would like to thank the following people who made this project possible:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prof. Dr. Markus Glaser} For supervising and supporting my project.
    \item \textbf{James Clough (Clough42)} For helping me to find hardware matching my specifications and supplying me with the great documentation about his own ELS project. 
\end{itemize}
